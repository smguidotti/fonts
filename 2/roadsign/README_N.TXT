
-This font is intended for printing and may not look its best on screen.

-This is a shareware product.  I have put a lot of time into creating the font.  You may evaluate it without cost.  If you decide to keep any of the included fonts installed or use any of the characters beyond simple evaluation then you must register the font.  If the quality is good enough to keep, then it's good enough to register.

-OVERVIEW AND WHAT'S NEW    (as of 12/18/96)

     Welcome.  If you are familiar with my fonts, then you should recognize the drastic change in documentation format.  I now have 27 rail font packages and a handful of non-rail fonts for Mac and IBM.  Most have never been released as shareware.  Categories include Railroad Lettering (Zephyr, GN, SAL, etc.), high resolution Rolling Stock Silhouettes that couple together in your document, Railroad Heralds, Snap Track and more.
     Managing the shareware has come to be a large task and registrations have decreased.  I have shifted to a prepay system for the new and updated fonts.  The prices are the same as before and the quality is better than ever.
     I have updated many of the fonts that were available as shareware, including all of the silhouette fonts, all of the AlphabetTrain fonts, the Heralds font (it has almost doubled in size as of this writing), and several of the lettering fonts.

     The new and revised fonts are ONLY AVAILABLE as prepay.  You should have a REG_FORM that lists the current fonts and prices.  I do not think I could ever take back the shareware I've already released and that is fine by me.  I wanted to give something back to the net and I also wanted to promote railroading.  So, I will continue to update the documentation in the last shareware release (from 12/96) to reflect the current state of affairs.  This release is merely a revision of documentation to reflect the new method of sales.

If you are interested in the prepay fonts, visit me on line at:
    http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~zephyr/TrainTracks.html
or send SASE for current catalog and ordering information to:  Benn Coifman, 1862 Euclid Ave #200F, Berkeley, CA 94709.  Be sure to include enough postage for 2 ounces.  Please do NOT send blank disks, I will provide them.




-USE OF THE FONTS

     Registration entitles you to use the fonts in normal correspondence, advertisements, books, magazine articles, and newsletters.  If you wish to sell the artwork in any form (e.g., stickers, decals, etc.) you must establish a separate licensing agreement.  Contact Benn Coifman for more information.

     If you use this font in a publication or on a product, please let me know.  It is always interesting to hear the clever uses people have had for my fonts.  (I would also love a copy for my scrap book).  Likewise, if you use the fonts to letter a rail car, please send a photograph.

     You may keep a copy of the shareware font, NOT installed on any computer after the trial period has expired.  However, you are not entitled to a second trial period for the same font package.  Upon reinstallation, you must pay the registration fee for the font.
     Each font or icon package is an individual product.  Thus, if you keep Passenger Font and Freight Font, you should pay $20, not $10.
     If you wish to use the fonts on more than one computer simultaneously, you must pay for multiple copies.  Each purchase entitles you to one active copy.  For large orders, tight budgets or places where US$ are hard to come by, feel free to contact me and negotiate a lower price or to trade goods and/or services for fonts.
     If you are only using the fonts for personal applications (non-business AND not for profit) or you wish to use the fonts strictly for a non-profit organization promoting rail interests, then the full registration fee for several fonts could come to be very expensive.  PLEASE PAY SOMETHING.  If you would like to negotiate a lower price, make me an offer (at least $5 per package, please).  I will consider all reasonable offers for personal use or non-profit rail groups.
     For personal applications, if money is tight or US$ are hard to come by, I will also accept any interesting widgets, toys, books, postcards, rail memorabilia, etc..  What's common place to you is quite possibly exotic for me.  By the way, I'm a rail fan (hint hint hint).




-DISTRIBUTION

     You may distribute this font or icon package FOR FREE provided you include ALL of the original, UNALTERED files and documentation AND make it clear that a registration fee is required; however, you may NOT sell this font or include it in any package FOR SALE OR PROFIT without the written permission of myself, Benjamin Coifman.  Furthermore, you must make it clear that the fonts are SHAREWARE, NOT freeware.  I have had problems with CDROM's suggesting that my software is free for their customers... IT'S NOT!

     "For free" means absolutely FREE, not as a bonus for purchasing another item, magazine, etc..  So, please contact me first.

	Having received permission to distribute an older version of the shareware package FOR PROFIT does not grant you rights to the current version of the shareware package.  With this release, all former distribution agreements are now terminated.  You must receive separate agreements for each new revision.

	Likewise, having received permission to distribute a different shareware package FOR PROFIT (or different version of the same shareware package) does not grant you rights to this package.  Mac and IBM versions are considered different shareware packages.

	Alternatively you may include this font package on a CDROM, in a shareware collection or some other means FOR PROFIT without my written permission provided you agree to pay me $10 per copy produced per shareware package used.  You must still include ALL of the original, UNALTERED files and documentation.

	By distributing this package FOR PROFIT (i.e., not "for free" as defined above) without my written permission, you agree to pay Benjamin Coifman $10 per copy produced per shareware package used.

	Likewise, by distributing this package without all of the original, unaltered documentation and files you agree to pay Benjamin Coifman $10 per copy produced per shareware package used.

	Dial up services that charge by the unit of time (e.g., Compuserve, America On Line and Prodigy) may distribute my shareware on their bulletin boards without contacting me provided the subscribers do not have to pay an extra fee to download my shareware.




-THE LEGAL BIT:

     All fonts and accompanying files are c1994-6 Benn Coifman and all artwork c1994-6 Benn Coifman, all rights reserved.  You may NOT distribute the font (software) except as proscribed above.  You may NOT resell the artwork in any form (including, but not limited to: badges, rubber stamps, stickers and decals) without the express written permission of Benn Coifman.  For each font package purchased, you are entitled to ONE copy installed on ONE computer at any given time.




-INSTALLING THE FONTS:

     IF YOU HAVE TROUBLES installing the fonts or they don't seem to print out correctly, PLEASE LET ME KNOW as soon as possible.  I can either give you more specific instillation information or go and fix the bug.  If you are having troubles printing, please TRY THE FOLLOWING TRICK FIRST: change the font size by +/- 1, often times it can work wonders (also see Windows tip below)

     The following explanation assumes you are installing Alphabet Train.  Follow the same procedure for other fonts.

MAC:

     On the Mac, the postscript version will require two files, one with the entire font name and the suffix, ".bmap" (the icon looks like a suitcase) and one with a truncated version of the font name (the icon looks like a laser printer).  The True Type version requires just one file with the suffix, ".suit" (the icon looks like a suitcase).

POST SCRIPT:
     Just drag the files: "AlphabetTrain.bmap", and "AlphaTra", onto your system folder and restart any applications that are currently running.  System 6 users have to use the font/DA mover, it is fairly straight forward and you should have documentation.

TRUE TYPE:
     Drag the SINGLE file: "AlphabetTrain.suit", onto your system folder

WARNING!!!
     DO NOT INSTALL THE TRUE TYPE AND POST SCRIPT VERSION OF THE SAME FONT AT THE SAME TIME.


WINDOWS TRUE TYPE:
     Locate the FONT control panel and open it.  Select the "Add Font" button.  Locate the True Type version of AlphabetTrain on your disk drives (it has the .TTF suffix)


WINDOWS TRUE TYPE TIP:
     If a complex True Type font fails to print, you may be able to solve the problem by changing the OutlineThreshold setting in the [True Type] section of your Windows WIN.INI file.  The default setting is 256 (pixels per em (if you don't know, don't worry)) and has a range of 0-300.  If you change it to 70 (i.e., OutlineThreshold=70), the True Type font might print.  The price of this improvement may be a slower print speed.  As I understand it, by lowering the OutlineThreshold, you are decreasing the amount of memory needed to print the fonts.

OTHER IBM APPLICATIONS:
Follow the application specific instructions for installing a Post Script Font




WHY SHOULD YOU SEND IN THE SHAREWARE FEE?

     I put a lot of hard work into this font.  I have also gotten a lot of pleasure from it.  Ignoring all of the capitalistic angles, your shareware dollar will speed up the development of new fonts and help me afford new font tools.  My goal is to at least break even.
     I now have about 250 registered users since I started producing fonts two and a half years ago.  There are a lot of expenses that go into these fonts.  My font editor cost over $300 and I just bought a new hard disk to keep all of the artwork on.  Then there are the little expenses like ink cartridges (you wouldn't believe how many ink cartridges I go through) and paying for a mail box.  Oy!  And you want to talk about memory... well, you get the idea.


BENEFITS OF PAYING THE SHAREWARE FEE:

     Enough of what shareware fees do for me, what will they do for you!?  I will spend less time on school and more time producing fonts.  Most of the shareware versions are out of date, if you specify which font(s) you are paying full registration for, what computer: Mac or IBM, and include a return address with your registration, I will return the complete, up to date font(s).  I might toss in a bonus font or two... maybe even something that hasn't been released yet.





-TIPS, ETC

     There are many uses for the rail fonts, here's a short list of examples:

+	Correspondence / Stationery
+	Birthday / Father's Day / etc.
+	Children (do you know a Thomas the Tank Engine fan?)
+	Business cards
+	Advertisements
+	Model railroad decals and detailing
+	Announcements
+	Brochures
+	Newsletters
+	Full sized railroad lettering
+	Screen savers (use text mode and select RR font to scroll trains across your screen)




WHAT DO YOU LIKE?  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS MISSING?

	Your feedback is important.  I never would have made Railroad Roman unless someone suggested it and provided me with reference material.  Let me know what you would like to see or to see more of.  Short of hiring me to do custom artwork, the best two ways to get me to make something are: (1) Send in your shareware fee.  (2) Provide reference material.  I have the Union Pacific lettering ready because a user sent in reference material.  Usually, all I need are photocopies to work from.  Contact me for more information.


DO YOU WANT YOUR CAR (OR DREAM CAR), LOGO OR HERALD ON YOUR KEYBOARD?  I am willing to do custom work, as my time allows, at reasonable rates.
