MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU:


For a list of my other great Railroad Fonts, send a SELF
ADDRESSED STAMPED ENVELOPE and a note asking for the current
catalog to address above:


  There are many uses for the rail fonts, here is just a
short list of examples:

*  Correspondence / Stationery
*  Birthday / Father's Day / etc.
*  Children (do you know a Thomas the Tank Engine fan?)
*  Business cards
*  Advertisements
*  Model railroad decals and detailing
*  Announcements
*  Brochures
*  Newsletters
*  Full sized railroad lettering
*  Screen savers (use text mode and select RR font to scroll
trains across your screen)


  Most of the packages are available for Mac and IBM in True
Type and Post Script (ATM) formats.  If you have WINDOWS,
OS/2 or a MACINTOSH, you are covered.  For DOS users, the
fonts should work for you if you can use True Type or Post
Script fonts.

  I have put thousands of hours into these fonts and I am
particular about details.  My fonts have appeared in Pacific
Rail News, Railway Age, Railfan and Railroad, Steam in the
Garden, and several other publications.  They have also been
used to letter train cars from N-scale all the way up to a
full sized coach.

  I can not guarantee that the fonts will work on every
computer system, but I can guarantee your purchase.  I offer
a 30 day money back guarantee if you are not completely
satisfied (see below).




30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE:
  If you are having troubles printing, please try the
following trick first: change the font size by +/- 1, often
times it can work wonders

  Since some computer systems have their own quarks, you may
not be able to get the font to print correctly, as a result,
these fonts are covered by a 30 day money back guarantee.
Simply mail the original disk(s) to me and a short note
describing your problems and I will refund your money less
$5 s/h.



THE LEGAL BIT:
  All fonts and accompanying files are c1994-6 Benn Coifman
and all artwork c1994-6 Benn Coifman, all rights reserved.
You may NOT distribute copies of the font (software) or
resell the artwork in any form (including, but not limited
to: badges, rubber stamps, stickers and decals) without the
express written permission of Benn Coifman.  You may only
distribute the software provided you include all original
disks and documentation AND you delete all copies you have
made.

     For each font package purchased, you are entitled to
ONE copy installed on ONE computer at any given time.  True
Type and Postscript versions; normal and simplified
versions; or any other variations contained with in a given
package are considered one font.  Such variations may be
installed on ONE computer simultaneously, but may not be
installed on multiple computers simultaneously unless
licenses have been purchased for ALL of the computers.  For
example, you may have RRRoman and RailroadRoman installed on
one computer, but you may NOT have the RRRoman installed on
one computer and RailroadRoman installed on another unless
you have two licenses.

     If any of the above terms are unacceptable, you may
return the fonts subject to the 30 money back guarantee.
